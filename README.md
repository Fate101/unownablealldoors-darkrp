# unownablealldoors-darkrp
This is a function for DarkRP That allows you to set all doors to unownable

It was driving me insane that I was getting objects with random "F2 to Own" on it and no way to remove it. So here is a complete rewrite of something I wrote 3 Years ago with error handling and a bit more logic.

Just download the repo and put the lua under `garrysmod > addons > darkrp_unownablealldoors`

Then just start the server. Ensure you have admin privileges and do `/setalldoorsunownable`
-**It has to be "/" and not "!"**

It'll then report back how many doors have been set unownable if it's worked
